#Project: Ghost
##Summary: This project is based on the game Ghost.
The normal variant of the game requires two or more competing players.
Each player has to pick a letter, clockwise, the first player to complete
a word after 3 letters loses the round. 
    
You usually play this game with more than 2 players. An extra feature of the
game, and of which the game name originates, is that when a player has lost
5 rounds, it becomes a ghost (on letter for each time the player loses a round,
thus G-H-O-S-T). A ghost can talk to players who still have not lost, if an
active player talks back to the ghost the active player himself turns into a
ghost. The last active player wins the game.

The game has mary variants. Which make it possible to either insert a letter
anywhere or for example mirror the word so that the beginning of the word becomes 
the end.
